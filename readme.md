# Jekylton

Jekylton is a skeleton-like-framework for Jekyll. It was built as a progressive alternative to the default theme for Jekyll, dropping support for outdated browsers while improving semantic structure and accessibility.

## Usage
Clone a copy of Jekylton over the top of a Jekyll site after you `jekyll new`. Version 2 will provide Jekyll theme support.
Use of a post-processor for prefixing is required.
