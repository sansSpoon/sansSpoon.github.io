I've started using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com "Sketch App") to do my prototyping. Here are some tips that I've learnt along the way.

- Use the `z` key to quickly zoom over a selection.
- Copy groups of elements in the Layers List `cmd-opt-1` from one layout to another with `opt+drag`.
- Use symbols to reuse elements üôÇ, <del>symbols can't be scaled ‚òπÔ∏è<del>.
- You can import RAW images!
- More to come
